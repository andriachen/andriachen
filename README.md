## Hi, I'm Andria! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior at Tufts University majoring in Cognitive and Brain Science and minoring in Computer Science on the pre-med track. My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of **neuroscience**, **machine learning**, and **healthcare technology**.

ðŸ§  Currently, Iâ€™m a fellow in the Break Through Tech AI program at MIT where I'm working on **practical, real-world ML problems** alongside industry mentors. I've also been involved in **research on Alzheimerâ€™s disease** where I explored the neural mechanisms behind memory and long-term synaptic plasticity. 

ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about inclusive innovation and science outreach. As a part of **Girlstart**, I lead STEM education programs that empower young girls to explore coding, robotics, and engineering.
